# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! To keep this small demo project tidy and easy to use, please follow these simple steps.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your work: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
3. Keep changes focused and document any new tools or dependencies in the notebook and `requirements.txt`.
4. Run the notebook locally and ensure your examples are reproducible.
5. Commit your changes and open a pull request with a clear description of what you changed and why.

If you add any long-running or potentially destructive cells to the notebook, please mark them clearly and provide safe defaults or guard conditions.

If you want code-style rules or automated checks added (formatting, linting, CI), open an issue first so we can discuss scope.
